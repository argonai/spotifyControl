# SpotifyControl

Simple plugin I whipped up in about 2-3 days because I was bored, currently no interest in getting it approved/maintaining it

# Commands

code is messy so:

```/spconfig``` opens the config menu
```/spcontrol``` controls the spotify player through the api

# Setup
all setup should be in the config menu, will probably crash at some point as i havent tested it much
