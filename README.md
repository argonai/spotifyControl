# SpotifyControl

Simple plugin I whipped up in about 2-3 days because I was bored, currently no interest in getting it approved/maintaining it

# Commands

code is messy so:

```/spconfig``` opens the config menu \
```/spcontrol``` controls the spotify player through the api, current args are self-explanatory ```play```, ```pause```, ```next``` and ```playback``` (automatically resumes/pauses based on current state, not tested)

# Setup
all setup should be in the config menu, will probably crash at some point as i havent tested it much
